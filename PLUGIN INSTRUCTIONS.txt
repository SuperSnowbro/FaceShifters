- Open the project
- The engine will ask to download the engine from the marketplace.
- Click Yes
- You will be directed to a Mega download page
- Make sure the project is closed. It will not open if you clicked Yes
- Download the file (be careful not to download the mega file manager, you can download the file directly from your browser)
- Copy the ZIP content into the project Plugins directory (it is a folder in the main project folder, along with Content and the other shit). If there is no 'Plugins' folder, create it and name it exactly 'Plugins'. It should be in the same folder as the .uproject file, the .gitignore file and all the other friends
- Open the project
- If after loading everything you can read -new plugins added to the project- or something like that, and by clicking on it you will be able to see the 'victory plugin' or something like that, it means you're a winner!
