- Open the project
- The engine will ask to download the engine from the marketplace.
- Click Yes
- You will be directed to a Mega download page
- Make sure the engine is closed. If the project is opening anyway, wait for it to open and close unreal engine
- Download the file (be careful not to download the mega file manager, you can download the file directly from your browser)
- Copy the ZIP content into the project Plugin directory (it is a folder in the main project folder, along with Content and the other shit)
- Open the project
- If after loading everything you can read -new plugins added to the project- or something like that, and by clicking on it you will be able to see the 'victory plugin' or something like that, it means you're a winner!
